Usage
-----
- A call that failed verification will be rejected and a failure notification shown
- A call that is unknown will be allowed and a notification shown
- A call that is verified will be allowed without any notification
- Calls from contacts or emergency numbers are always allowed

Requirements
------------
- Your device must have official support for Android 11 or higher
- If seemingly all received calls are unknown state, your device/carrier is likely incompatible
